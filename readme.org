*** Simplified Setup
- This setup is buil to mimic the workflow from David Allen's "Getting Things
  Done". Even if you do not use Emacs, I would highly suggest reading his book.
- File menu is enabled for those shy of remembering keyboard shortcuts
- All of your work can be seen from Org Agenda
  -

*** Things on my TODO list
- Simplified Keyboad Mappings
- Finishing up the super agenda groups
